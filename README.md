## Getting Started
1. `npm install`
2. `yarn start`

Please upload it to a public repository (on Github) and keep your commits organised so we can review your work. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to pauline.coupez@kombo.co

## Test Objectives
We are giving you two (2) main tasks, and they can be tackled in any order. Do your best! It should take you between 3-5 hours, depending on your experience. Overall, we are looking to see how you can handle concepts our team deals with on a daily basis.

### ‚ú® Redesign
**Sample scenario**: we have a new [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/Rzu1vT1SVrRCn3RF8wZ2Ez/Front-design-test?node-id=0-1&t=YZQkz9LiFrgWh7IZ-1) for the tickets we sell on Kombo. We have already given you relevant ticket information from the API. Please implement your design changes however you see fit.

Relevant files:

* `src/components/TicketResult.tsx`
* `src/components/TicketResult.module.css`

| From this                                | to this                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ![](./readme/ticketResultUndesigned.png) | ![](./readme/ticketResultFigma.png) |

Here, we are looking for how you handle:

* CSS, variables, and general design
* Responsive development - mobile first, please!
* HTML structure

### üîê Implement
**Sample scenario**: We want to display more ticket details to the user after they have selected a ticket. The design is already done for you, but none of the information is called, connected, or displayed. Please implement the changes however you see fit.

Relevant files:

* `src/pages/TicketInfo.tsx`
* feel free to create additional files to organize your code.

| Uh oh! Static data!          | Dynamically display here:    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ![](./readme/staticdata.png) | ![](./readme/ticketInfo.png) |

Please keep in mind:

* Hooks, context, and other React tools
* Efficient API calls
* General component abstraction

## API Documentation
Type information can be found in `src/types.ts`. You only have one available endpoint for https://kombo-nextjs-api.vercel.app/api and we have already provided you with the necessary request with Axios in `src/service/api.ts`.

| METHOD | ENDPOINT   | RESPONSE                  |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| GET    | `/tickets` | array of `Ticket` objects |
